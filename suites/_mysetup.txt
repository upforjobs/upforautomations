${description1}          Some keywords that may cause a page to load take an additional argument dont wait that is used to determine whether a new page is expected to load or not. By default, a page load is expected to happen whenever a link or image is clicked, or a form submitted.
${description}          I would keep the headlines in one color to be distinctive, having split like this can only make confusion. Slider arrows on the left and right could be downsized to 50-75% of this size and placed about 50px away of the carousel on each side. I vote for the carousel with wider boxes.
